# Detection Module
This module provides scripts for performing detection using SSD models. Note that caffe must be installed using SSD caffe.

## `detection.py`
This file houses the `SSDDetect` class, which provides a `detect_vid()` function for performing detection on videos.

## `demo.py`
This script uses the `SSDDetect` class to demonstrate how the resulting detections can be drawn on the video and saved to a new video file.

## `file_demo.py`
This script uses the `SSDDetect` class to write the results from a video to an easily parsed text file.

## `plot_file.py`
This script provides a demo of how the detections from the text files generated by `file_demo.py` can be parsed and used. The script takes one frame from the video and plots the detection on that frame.
